# The Electric Book Manager

The Electric Book Manager is Fire and Lion’s tool for client-side content management. 

The content of each book is stored in the cloud as a separate GitHub repository.. Each repository uses The Electric Book Template, an open-source tool for creating books and book-like websites. This documentation is for the Electric Book Manager; for information on using the Electric Book Template, see the ‘docs’ folder within the template you are using, or visit http://electricbook.works/docs/ for the vanilla template information.
