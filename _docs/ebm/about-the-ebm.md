# The Electric Book Manager
{:.no_toc}

* Page contents
{:toc}

The Electric Book Manager makes it easier for non-technical editors to use the Electric Book Workflow online, without installing anything on their own computers.

Using the EBM, each user's books are stored in the cloud in GitHub repositories. Each repository uses the Electric Book template, an open-source tool for creating books and book-like websites.

## Hosted service

You can have a developer [set up your own EBM](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-gui) or pay for access to an existing one.

[Fire and Lion](https://fireandlion.com) maintains a paid EBM service for clients. [Contact Fire and Lion](mailto:team@fireandlion.com) for details.
